## Hey there, I'm Ansh 👋

### What am I up to ?:
- 🔭 I'm currently researching at the Cryptography, Security and Privacy Lab at my University to make models resistant to website fingerprinting attacks. Outside of school, I'm working on rooting different boxes on Hack The Box and spending time on TryHackMe.
- 🌱 I’m also learning more about Infrastructure as Code tools like Kubernetes and Terraform
- 👯 I’m currently looking for Full Time opportunities in security and software engineering
- 🥅 2025 Goals: Run 30km in sub 3 hours, and lose some weight!(well that's every year's goal so nothing special)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once performed 2 consecutive flips in one swirl of a pancake
