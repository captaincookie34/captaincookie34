## Hey there, I'm Ansh 👋

### What am I up to ?:

- 🛠️Outside of school, I'm working on rooting different boxes on Hack The Box and spending time on TryHackMe.
- 🌱 I’m also learning more about Infrastructure as Code tools like Kubernetes and Terraform
- 👯 I’m currently looking for Full Time opportunities in security and software engineering
- 🥅 2025 Goals: Run 30km in sub 3 hours, and lose some weight!(well that's every year's goal so nothing special)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once performed 2 consecutive flips in one swirl of a pancake
